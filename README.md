# ICB Interactive Prescribing Dashboard Project
This project is a digital pilot aimed at developing an interactive dashboard to assist the Integrated Care Board (ICB) in decision-making related to resource and cost management for various drugs across GP practices by leveraging Agile methodologies.

Project Goals:
Phase 1:
- Develop a working prototype of the dashboard using a lightweight subset of the intended data
- Enable ICB members to manage and visualize drug costs and resource distribution efficiently
- Implement an intuitive, user-friendly interface suitable for non-technical users

Phase 2 (Future Scope):
- Expand access to GP practices within the ICB catchment area
- Enable benchmarking so practices can compare their performance against similar practices and regional averages

Agile Development Approach:
This project follows an Agile methodology with an iterative development process
- Backlog & Prioritization: Requirements are broken down into user stories and prioritized
- Sprints & Demos: Work is completed in bi-weekly sprints, with regular demos for customer feedback, and documented on the Trello Board
- Sprint Retrospective: Internal Agile team, reflect what went well and wrong, prioritize the value important for customer depending on the review, plan how to change in the next review

Installation & Setup:
- Step 1: Create a new repository from the project skeleton
- Step 2: Manage access to the collaborators
- Step 3: Create a new folder/directory for the project
- Step 4: Git clone
  #cd "pathway-of-the-new-folder"
  #git init
  #git clone https://github.com/Rokevh/MIE-Dashboard-Echo.git

Git Strategy:
- Step 1: Create a remote branch for each new feature
- Step 2: Create a local branch for the feature
- Step 3: Pull from remote to the local branch
- Step 4: Implement the changes and commit 
- Step 5: Push the local branch to the remote branch
- Step 6: Submit a pull request for review
- Step 7: Merge with the remote master file
